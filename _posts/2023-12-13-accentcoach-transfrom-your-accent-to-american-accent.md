Accent reduction is a goal that a lot of non-native English speakers persue. A big obstacle is that they often listen to native speakers’ speech, but they have never heard how they sound with a native accent. Comparing one’s own accent with a native accent can help the learner identify the areas that need improvement and enhance their pronunciation. Think of it like a personal AI accent coach.

Now how can we change the accent of a non-native English speaker to sound like a native American speaker? Well, It turns out by carefully adjusting the prosody and timbre in a TTS model such as [StyleTTS2](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2), we can achieve this accent transformation with ease. 


I created a demo on HuggingFace called AccentCoach that can transform any accent to an American accent. The output sounds a bit robotic, but it is good enough to assist English language learners. Let's hear two examples first.


Einstein's distinct German accent:

Here is his American accent produced by AccentCoach:

Arnold Schwarzenegger's Austrian accent:

Here is his American accent produced by AccentCoach:
<audio controls="controls" preload="auto" src="/assets/audio/Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Native-American-Accent.wav">

</audio>


Curious about how you'd sound with an American accent? Give the demo a try! 

Attention: It's highly recommended to clone the space and run it either locally or on a powerful GPU on HuggingFace.
