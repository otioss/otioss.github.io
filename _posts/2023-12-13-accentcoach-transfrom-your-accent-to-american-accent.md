You probably have heard Einstein's distinct German accent:

<audio controls="controls" preload="auto" src="/assets/audio/Albert-Einstein.wav">
<p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio>

Is it possible to transform Einstein's accent into an American accent? By carefully adjusting the prosody and timbre in a TTS model such as [StyleTTS2](https://github.com/yl4579/StyleTTS2), one can easily transform Einsten's accent into an American accent:

Here is another example that needs no introduction: Arnold Schwarzenegger:
<audio controls="controls" preload="auto" src="/assets/audio/Arnold-Schwarzenegger.wav">

</audio>

Here is his synthesized American accent:

I created a demo on HuggingFace named [AccentCoach](https://huggingface.co/spaces/otioss/AccentCoach) that allows you to change your accent or any accent to American accent. I think this tool could be very useful for English learners. It can greatly assist with improving your accent and pronunciation

Curious about how you'd sound with an American accent? Give the demo a try!
