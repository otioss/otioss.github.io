I did a little experiment the other day. You've probably heard about StyleTTS2 which was released last month. One interesting effect is that by adjusting the value of alpha and beta you can transform any accent into American accent. Combine it with Whisper and suddenly you have an AI accent coach. 

First, let's try this with two individuals in history who have had a recognizable accent: Albert Einstein and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Here is  Einstein's distinct German accent:

<audio controls="controls" preload="auto" src="/assets/audio/Albert-Einstein.wav">

And here is Einstein's AI-generated American accent:

Here is Arnold Schwarzenegger's accent:

His AI-generated American accent:

</audio>

pretty cool, huh?

I put together a demo on HuggingFace called AccentCoach that you can use to transfrom your accent or any accent into American accent. I believe this tool could be extremely value for English learners. It can be a tremendous help with accent reduction and pronuncation. 

You want to see how you sound like with an American accent? you can try the demo:

Although this is more like a STTS rather than SS. I still thought it's a neat trick for those who struggle with accent reduction.
